## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation analysis of investment strategies, demonstrating counter-intuitive findings about mathematical expectations vs. real-world outcomes.

### 🔍 **What's Analyzed:**
- Expected value calculations for coin-flip investment games
- Single vs. multiple simulation comparisons  
- Probability analysis of final account balances
- Strategy comparison between original and modified approaches
- Professional visualizations and statistical insights

### 📁 **Files:**
- `index.html` - Complete analysis website (live at link above)
- `SimulationChallenge.html` - Original HTML file
- `SimulationChallenge.qmd` - Source Quarto document
- `SimulationChallenge_files/` - Supporting assets and visualizations

### 🎓 **Challenge Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Expected value analysis (Question 1)
- ✅ Expectation vs. reality analysis (Question 2) 
- ✅ Single simulation with time series plot (Question 3)
- ✅ 100 simulations with distribution analysis (Question 4)
- ✅ Probability calculations (Question 5)
